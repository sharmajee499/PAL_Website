<h3>What is the People Analytics Lab (PAL)?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2em; font-size:1.2em">
<strong>PAL</strong> is an applied social science lab is in the tradition of industrial and organizational psychology (see <a href="https://siop.org" target="_blank">siop.org</a> for more details on the discipline). In the lab, students can find opportunities for professional development that will prepare them for their careers (e.g., grad school, entering technical entry-level analyst roles), learn about open science and open practice within the Human Resources and I/O Psychology domain, and gain opportunities to learn about or apply psychological theory to solve a variety of problems in organizational life.
</p>
<p style="line-height: 2em; font-size:1.2em">
Students can start small, working in a one-on-one manner with Dr. Castille, supporting the labs activities (e.g., reading/reviewing articles, helping other project associates in their work, etc.). One big set of opportunities for students involves learning how to apply data analytics and project management tools, which include <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><strong>R</strong></a>, <a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong></a>, <a href="https://rstudio.com/" target="_blank"><strong>R Studio</strong></a>, <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>GitHub</strong></a>, <a href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Slack</strong></a>, and <a href="https://trello.com/en-US" target="_blank"><strong>Trello</strong></a>, which could be beneficial for a career in HR or people analytics. These tools are valued chiefly because they make insights - and how those insights were derived - transparent and reproducible.

<div id="why-did-we-create-the-pal" class="section level3">
<h3>Why did we create the PAL?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2em; font-size:1.2em">
We created the PAL at NSU to give students opportunities to do research that informs the practice of industrial/organizational psychology. Dr. Christopher Castille’s research focus is on individual differences in the workplace. Specifically, he examines the role of personality traits in the work setting. He is also interested in examining how receiving observer reports of personality (e.g., having co-workers describe your interpersonal style) might relate to productive behavioral changes in the workplace. Dr. Ann-Marie Castille’s research focus is on how performance feedback can help or harm performance in the workplace. She also studies issues relating to gender and leadership.

<p style="line-height: 2em; font-size:1.2em">
We hope that the experiences give you a spring board to start their graduate education in I/O psych or a related discipline (e.g., getting your MBA, or entering practice). Importantly, many of the activities in the lab are conducted virtually, meaning that students don’t have to be from our institution or near Thibodaux, LA. Indeed, we’ve had students participate from other schools as well (e.g., Villanova University, Rutgers Business School). Keep in mind that our research focuses on many areas but do include specifically:

<h3>Social events (for those local to Thibodaux, LA)</h3>
<p style="line-height: 2em; font-size:1.2em">
We want to build a community of students that work hard but also get to know each other. Lab students often build deep friendships, working closely with each other for years. Many lab member remain connected to the lab even after graduation, coming back as guest speakers or mentoring new students.
