# PAL_Website

PAL website is running using blogdown as a backend server which has frontend UI of [Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) theme from [Hugo](https://themes.gohugo.io). 
One of the best resource that is used to formulate this website is from [this](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown) book. 

### Some of the key notes while developing the website:
- Sometimes the file has to be on .Rmarkdown extension. However, sometimes it will also work on .Rmd. One might have to check which will work. 
- Don't forget to delete the **public** folder after building the website.
