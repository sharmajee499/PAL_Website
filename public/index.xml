      <description>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure - Goodhart’s law
I was recently interviewed by Vinay Patel and Joe Meyer of Louisiana Tech University (shout out to the Bulldogs!) on the topic of open science in IO psychology. In their article titled “We want open science in I-O!…Do we?” Vinay and Joe gave a broad overview of what open science is and why it particularly relevant for IO psychology.</description>

      <description>Author : Dr. Christopher CastilleThis year, we, Ann-Marie Castille (my better half over in the Computer Information Systems Department here at NSU and fellow I/O psychologist) and I founded the People Analytics Lab @ NSU. It is a social science lab that gives students opportunities to learn how to conduct research as it relates to organizational life. Thus far, there have been a few positive outcomes. One that I am particularly proud of involves a few students in our lab (Sarah Avet, Kathryn Daigle, and Bernard Wazeman).</description>

      <description>What is the People Analytics Lab (PAL)?PAL is an applied social science lab is in the tradition of industrial and organizational psychology (see siop.org for more details on the discipline). In the lab, students can find opportunities for professional development that will prepare them for their careers (e.g., grad school, entering technical entry-level analyst roles), learn about open science and open practice within the Human Resources and I/O Psychology domain, and gain opportunities to learn about or apply psychological theory to solve a variety of problems in organizational life.</description>
